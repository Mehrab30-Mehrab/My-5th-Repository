<b>Welcome to the **Leap Year Checker**! 🚀 This program helps you determine whether a specific year is a leap year. Leap years are crucial for keeping our calendar in alignment with Earth's revolutions around the Sun. 🌍</b>

## 🧠 Understanding Leap Years

A year is a **leap year** if it satisfies the following conditions:

- 📅 Divisible by 4  
- ❌ Not divisible by 100, unless...  
- ✅ It is also divisible by 400  

This means that while the year 2000 was a leap year, 1900 was not. This adjustment ensures our calendar remains accurate over time.
